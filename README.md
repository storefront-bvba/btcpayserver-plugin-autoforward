# Auto-Forward Plugin for BTCPay Server
This plugin allows you to accept payments and auto-forward a percentage of the received funds to another address.

For full documentation, see the help page included in the plugin or Views/UIAutoForward/Help.cshtml in code.

## Unit Tests
Since BTCPay Server Plugins don't support unit tests yet, the files in `Tests` should be symlinked to from the `BTCPayServer.Tests` project. We keep the actual files here so they stay with the plugin code, but they are never run here.
